## 6. Warranty Disclaimer.

1. Generally.
   1. DEQUE PROVIDES THE PRODUCT, THE DOCUMENTATION, AND ALL OTHER GOODS, SERVICES, AND SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH ALL FAULTS;
   2. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND EFFORT IS WITH CUSTOMER; AND
   3. DEQUE MAKES NO WARRANTY AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH ANY PERSON’S ENJOYMENT OF THE PRODUCT, THE DOCUMENTATION, OR ANY OTHER GOOD, SERVICE, OR SOFTWARE, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, OR OF FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABILITY.
2. Deque further disclaims any obligation or liability with respect to any third-party components of the Product or third-party materials distributed with the Product. Without limiting the foregoing, this disclaimer includes any open-source materials.

## 7. Confidentiality.

1. “Confidential Information” means any information belonging to, or held by, Deque whether fixed in a tangible medium or otherwise, that is:

   1. Not readily ascertainable by proper means by the public; and
   2. The subject of commercially reasonable efforts by Deque under the circumstances to maintain as confidential;

   The Product is also Deque’s Confidential Information.

2. Customer will do the following things with regard to the Confidential Information.
   1. Prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by Customer and each of Customer’s employees, agents, and/or professionals to any third party other than as permitted under this Agreement.
   2. Use, and permit the use of, the Confidential Information only for the purpose of performing Customer’s obligations, or enjoying its rights, under this Agreement (the “Purpose”).
   3. Disclose the Confidential Information only to such of Customer’s employees and agents (each a “Representative”) as have a bona fide need to possess or know the Confidential Information in the course of accomplishing the Purpose.
   4. Cause each Representative to whom Customer discloses the Confidential Information to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality that is at least as rigorous as the obligations contained in this Agreement. Each professional, such as a lawyer or an accountant, actually retained by Customer in a professional-client relationship will be deemed under an adequate obligation of confidentiality for the purposes of this Agreement so long as the law recognizes an obligation of confidence actionable by Customer under law without a separate contractual obligation.
   5. Return or destroy all written or other tangible copies of Confidential Information in Customer’s possession or direct or indirect control, including all extracts and copies thereof, within a reasonable time after, and in accordance with, Deque’s request.
3. Nothing in this Section 7 will prevent Customer from disclosing or using the Confidential Information of Deque to the extent that:
   1. It is or becomes readily ascertainable by proper means by the public without any breach by Customer of Section 7(b);
   2. It is received from a third Party that is not under an obligation of confidentiality of which Customer knew or had reason to know;
   3. It is independently developed by Customer without use of Deque’s Confidential Information; or
   4. It is required by law to be disclosed, provided that Customer (to the extent not prohibited by law):
      1. Provides to Deque as much notice as is practicable under the circumstances of such requirement;
      2. Provides to Deque, at Deque’s expense, such reasonable assistance as Deque requests in seeking confidential treatment, protective orders, nondisclosure, and/or similar measures; and
      3. Discloses only such Confidential Information as Customer, upon advice of its counsel, believes is required to be disclosed.
4. Because unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information might result in immediate and irreparable injury to Deque, for which monetary damages might not be adequate, if Customer or any officer, director, employee, agent, professional, or subcontractor of Customer uses or discloses Confidential Information or any such person is likely to use or disclose Confidential Information in breach of Customer’s obligations under this Agreement, Deque will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including temporary and permanent injunctive relief and specific performance. The rights in this Section 7(d) are in addition to any other rights of Deque under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.
5. The obligations under this Section 7 will continue after disclosure of each item of Confidential Information for the longer of:
   1. Five years after initial disclosure of that item of Confidential Information; or
   2. The time during which the Confidential Information remains a trade secret (as that term is defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act) of Deque.

## 8. Limitation of Liability.

1. DEQUE WILL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, STRICT LIABILITY OR NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA, OR ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE).
2. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8 APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT A PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A PARTICULAR KIND OF DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT ANY LIMITATION CAUSES A REMEDY TO FAIL OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

## 9. Termination.

Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies at law, equity, or otherwise of Deque, Deque may terminate this Agreement upon notice to Customer if:

1. Customer breaches this Agreement; or
2. Customer becomes unable generally to pay its debts as they become due; ceases to do business in the ordinary course; or dissolves or ceases to exist or its governing body approves the same.

## 10. Miscellaneous.

1. Force Majeure. Deque will not be liable for any failure to perform or for delay in performance of its obligations hereunder caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, communications systems failures or outages, fire, storm, flood, earthquake, explosion, lighting, riot, acts of vandalism, accident, acts of the public enemy, war, rebellion, insurrection, sabotage, epidemic, quarantine restrictions, labor disputes, transportation embargoes, acts of God, acts of any government or agency thereof or judicial action.
2. Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, all remedies of Deque are cumulative and may be exercised concurrently or separately.
3. Waiver of Default. Any waiver of any default of this Agreement shall be limited to the particular instance and shall not operate or be deemed to waive any future default of it nor shall any delay on the part of either party to act upon any default be deemed a waiver thereof.
4. Enforceability. In the event that any one or more provisions contained in this Agreement are unenforceable, such enforceability shall not affect any other provision of the Agreement, but the Agreement shall be construed as though such unenforceable provisions had not been contained herein, and a new enforceable provision that accomplishes the interest of the severed provision as nearly as practicable shall be substituted therefor.
5. Notices. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed effective (a) if given by personal delivery, upon such personal delivery or (b) if given by nationally-recognized courier or mail service (in either case that has realtime or near-realtime tracking), at the time that the notice is delivered to the receiver’s premises according to the tracking records of the courier or mail service.

   Either party may change its address for notice by notice to the other party.
6. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Forum.
   1. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America without regard for its conflict of laws provisions. Any claim, suit, or cause of action arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement must be brought solely in the Virginia courts sitting in Fairfax County, Virginia or in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and each party irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, such courts.
   2. Notwithstanding anything in Section 10(f)(i) to the contrary, at Deque’s option and upon notice given by Deque, the parties will resolve any claim, suit, or cause of action, or portion thereof, by arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. In such a case:
      1. The language of the arbitration will be English;
      2. The place of the arbitration will be London, England;
      3. The parties will cause the arbitrator(s) to, to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable rules, permit participation in the arbitration by remote means, including, but not limited to, videoconference and teleconference, and will structure such remote participation in a manner reasonably calculated to give the parties the opportunity to be on equal footing for interactions during the arbitration (such as, but not limited to, requiring that both parties present by teleconference regardless of whether a party is presenting from a remote location);
      4. The judgment and award of the arbitrator(s) may be entered in, and enforced by, any court of competent jurisdiction; and
   3. Nothing in this Section 10(f)(ii) will prevent either party from seeking in any court any relief not reasonably available from an arbitrator.
7. Assignment. Customer may not assign any right or obligation under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Deque may freely assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement. Upon any assignment by Deque of obligations under this Agreement, any further liability of Deque with respect to the assigned obligations will end.
8. Relationship. Deque and Customer are independent principals in all relationships and actions under and contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be construed to create any employment, partnership or joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties.
9. Survival. Any right or obligation that accrues prior to the termination of this Agreement for any reason will survive such termination. The provisions of Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 will survive indefinitely the termination of this Agreement for any reason. (it being understood that any license that survives where Customer terminates this Agreement for default by Deque will be and remain subject to the restrictions in this Agreement that apply to the license and will be terminable by Deque upon violation of any such restriction).
10. Deque may revise the Product at any time.
11. Deque may revise this Agreement at any time and any such revision will become effective upon Deque giving notice to you of the revision(s) or Deque posting the revised form of Agreement on Deque’s website or other online resource and/or on the website or other resource from which you received the Product.
12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter of this Agreement. No amendment to this Agreement will bind Deque unless such amendment is in the form of a writing signed by Deque that expressly amends this Agreement.
